That means 3-5% more people died that year than the previous year. WHO said like april 2020 that the risk of death was 3-5% or something. But I think we can say with a fair amount of certainty that is not the case.\n\nConsidering how old people are when they die on average, more than 1% of the population dies every year. That means that if the excess mortality is 3-5% then 1.03-1.05% die one year instead of 1% if we make it simple by assuming deaths per year is 1% instead of what it actually is.\n\n2002 we had 95000 deaths in Sweden. (population 8.9M)\n2020 we had 98000 deaths in Sweden. (population 10.3M)\n\nIt's actually been a fair debate about the mistreatment of elderly in teh healthcare system during this \"pandemic\".

I think they should dump the crafting tables, get back Origin shops and have crafting be something you do at your own stations with station crafting buildings. Crafting should cost material, energy and time. Now you spend like 9000kv to make a weapon that is 40kv. It makes no sense. It would be better if you just spend cash at the shop and if you wanted to craft shit you build your own crafting station. If you power it with solar panels it will be cheaper but takes more time than if you burn nhurgite or exorium. Maybe later there will be production facilities at player stations that produce things that origin can not. Which would make the economy much more interesting, IMO. What do you think?"}

You don't need a fighter that can fly for 5 hours for siege, because no fighter will last 5 hours.

If a siege lasts for 5 hours you are either getting blown up 30 times or the action is so little that your fighter will just be sitting in space not consuming resources. If you need to transport a fighter far, you bring supply ships, just like in real life.

Don't over train your muscles early and don't do heavy weights on dangerous exercises dead lift. You can probably train for a full month before you need really try to drain your muscles. If you are sore for 4+ days I would say you have over done it. 2-3 is enough. After you have consistency the main focus should be to reduce risk of injury, which is the greatest risk to consistency and thus results. Shoulders and back are probably the easiest to injure. They can also take a long time to heal and fuck with a surprisingly wide range of exercises. You can also fuck your neck while training traps if you are not careful and with military press. Squats is fairly dangerous too, I would say, but I don't do them so I don't have much experience with them. I have just heard and seen people fuck their shit up, like knees. Just go easy with them in the beginning if you wanna do them and make sure you have proper form. Shoulders can easily become fucked from something so simple as not enough stretching making the front shoulder too short. It can also fuck your posture and increase risk of back problems."}

If the US can not hold Afghanistan, how the fuck do you expect Russia to hold half of Europe? The problems in Ukraine should not come as a surprise to anyone that has listened to anything Russia has said for many years. This is the result of chicken race politics. Russia has clearly stated what they think about the situation in Ukraine and has felt threatened by NATO crawling closer and closer. Yet the west has kept pushing and even supported a coup in Ukraine. It is no surprise if Russia completely wrecks all advanced military capabilities in Ukraine and takes a large chunk of eastern Ukraine. If you could not see this coming and understand why it happened, you have no understanding of what will happen next. I don't think Russia or the rest of Europe are interested in losing 20% of their population over this bullshit. If you think Russia will just keep rolling west for \"resources\" you are fucking stupid. This is a national security operation and not a resource grab. I think the real question is if they take 1/3 of Ukraine or the whole of Ukraine. It's easier to occupy territory where you have strong support. It might be more of a pain in the ass to try and hold the whole country, both militarily and diplomatically.\n\nWW2 was industrialised total war. I don't think there is any risk of total war, and with anything less than that, there will be no great moving border across half of Europe. The best thing is for the Russian people to seriously consider how much of this they will tolerate. The leadership of Russia can only act within certain limits of what it's population will tolerate, and the military is part of the population of Russia. If the leadership of Russia starts getting delusional, the people should take them back to reality. If this escapade becomes too adventurous, it will be detrimental to everyone."}

It has been this way since the Soviet Union and anyone who has watched Chernobyl basically understand the situation. We have the same problem in western Europe, which is why we are slowly collapsing, it is just 5 times worse in Russia.\n\nRegarding Wagner being illegal but allowed to operate because it is useful, we have laws that work similarly in Sweden. We have tax laws for non profit organisations that basically no one knows about and everyone is breaking. The government uses this law to clamp down on certain organisations that they don't like while 90% of organisations will never be made aware that they are breaking the law because no one gives a shit. \n\nIt is the same with the \"incitement of hatred\" law or whatever you want to call it that the government uses whimsically to target political opposition. \n\nThe government is also getting private corporations to do the censorship of political speak that the government itself can not legally do. They sent representatives to YouTube to tell them to shut down certain channels, for example. This is also very much going on in the US where the \"intelligence\" agencies are both sending YouTube, Twitter and others instructions about which accounts to block and ban while at the same time they have feds working in said agencies. \n\nAnother thing that is becoming more common is the banks shutting down bank accounts for people \"suspected of money laundering\" because they are receiving small donations directly to their bank account. You may also be aware that Patreon, Paypal, Visa, Mastercard and others have targeted certain political figures and groups. This is often connected to international NGOs or secret police. The method is clearly shady since the reason people have their bank accounts frozen or their accounts banned are often not mentioned directly but they just tell you you broke some rule without specifying which one."}

The passports make no sense because there is no evidence of vaccinated not spreading C-19 but much evidence of the contrary. There is also no reason to check people for c-19 when they are travelling between two countries with similar amount of c-19 spread in society as we had in Europe 2021 and onward. Unvaccinated don't put vaccinated at risk if the vaccines are effective, which they said they were. The vaccine passports only made sense to increase control and surveillance in a way that people could be made to believe it was about something else and a good idea.\n\nanyway...\nMost of what he said in the video you linked made logical sense, but he said nothing to back up his claim that sending a cruise missile into an apartment building was done intentionally to boost support for the war. I'm quite sure it is not intentional and I am quite sure no one is more supportive of the war because of it, just as I am certain that the Ukrainian runaway S-300 missile that landed in Poland and Zelensky blamed on Russia was not a deliberate false flag attack by Ukraine. Shit happens in war and missiles don't always go where you want them to for various reasons."}

It was released in February 1998 as a replacement for the original Voodoo Graphics chipset. The card runs at a chipset clock rate of 90 MHz and uses 100 MHz EDO DRAM, and is available for the PCI interface. The Voodoo2 comes in two models, one with 8 MB RAM and one with 12 MB RAM. The 8 MB card has 2 MB of memory per texture mapping unit (TMU) vs. 4 MB on the 12 MB model. The 4 MB framebuffer on both cards support a maximum screen resolution of 800 \u00d7 600, while the increased texture memory on the 12 MB card allows more detailed textures. Some boards with 8 MB can be upgraded to 12 MB with an additional daughter board."}
