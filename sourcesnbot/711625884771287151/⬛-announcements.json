Station 13 is chosen due to location of the station itself and the location that our allies in Concordia have chosen for themselves. \nTry to get up to speed fast, get some credits and mine some ores after doing the tutorial then come back to this discord and import either <@!93299542836912128>  or <@!229986947727228941>  light and cheap starter ships that i will link in <#869340130358476840>  to then explore and mine with. Feel free to sell some ore back to the station marketplace itself but keep some in your inventory. We don't know the exact costs of ores quite yet but we will be building an ore/materials stash station within the dev zone itself. Try to avoid wasting too much time chasing down people as its abit counterproductive but dont shy away from pirating or shooting at others as you see fit. \n\nAny further announcments will be made in this channel, and ill be sending a Discord profile picture overlay of our faction shortly if you feel like representing yourself in VIR colors abit further. Cheers <:nomads:812294421731213322>"}

Also I would like to ask you all to behave, chanting \"collective bad\" is funny sometimes but don't overdo it, it can easily be spinned against us to harm our own reputation and make us look like a bunch of 10 year olds.

Firstly it is for only 6 players, and secondly, there is not much variation in playstyle once everyone has 'mastered' the game (we've seen 2.5-hour games be reduced to 30-45 mins) **Polytopia** solves these problems with different 'tribes' with abilities and up to **15 players** (The reason why I'm opening it to more people) and maintaining a similar **simplicity** as risk making it easy to pick up whilst offering more **depth** so a game will last longer and be less predictable. \n\nIt's on **50% off** right now at around 5 euros on steam for **6 more hours**, and I'd expect to get a month of play out of it as once we have done this internal test, I'd like to open it to the broader community.
