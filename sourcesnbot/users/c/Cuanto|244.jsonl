Events were impossible because I couldn't even link a discord invite in the official discord's events channel. Even warning one week before the event, and doing a full month tournament with 2 videos sponsored in some official videos and monthly community reports, I couldn't get enough people in the events\n\nJust when the endocup first season ends, some groups decide to host public events all of a sudden and _viol\u00e1_ , now you can put events in the official discord! And they will show on the top of the channel list so everyone can see them! well fuck you, you just ruined a whole month worth of work. And just when it's ending, you decide it's a good moment to allow and support events? I tried to build the first public social infrastructure to test and host PvP events and activities in your trash game and you will use my content so you can show it in reports to tell everyone how active the game is, but won't even allow to write a fkin discord link in the channel because oops, it's against ThE rUleS\n\nWhat that did, is make the endocup look like a failure and look like trash, while the next events that are now supported will have a lot of success compared to the first one, which always has to be the one who gets support. I did not work that hard thinking about ranking and scoring systems, motivating and talking to people to create an active sphere, just to see how others take profit from it. I'm done with it and will never create content for a trash game like starbase\n\nI consider starbase just another scam, they sold it with the idea that they were working super hard and in 6-7 months it would be playable.\nTurns out we're almost on february and the game doesn't even have a chore mechanic. No PvE, no AI. Just a tech demo. That's illegal, that's why I can refund.||"}
