Please do not try to establish a player station in its area on the live server, as such stations will get moved.\nThere will initially be asteroids inside the safe zone. This is intended, as players seeking a brief refuge for mining can mine in safety until the asteroids are depleted. Note that you need to first get to the station to benefit from this. Also the station is not located in the highest tier asteroid zone.\n\nAnimations\n \nFixed 1st person Pipe Tool fire animation not activating correctly\nFixed animation not activating correctly when removing a weapon from a Tripod\nFixed legs not animating correctly during movement when firing the Shotgun\nFixed sprint animation looking wrong when equipped with Tripod autocannon\n\nAudio\n \nAdded UI sounds for Pilot Chair bind menu\nAdded missing sounds for Auction House UI\nFixed incorrect window closing sounds when the Research Tree hadn't been visible\nNew Audio Signal Device sounds\nToned down environmental noise when player is working in an in-game editor\n\nCompanies\n \nFixed an issue that caused creating company ranks to fail for new companies\n\nCrafting"}
