Heat detection is good for seeing them in a cloud but shouldn\u2019t be a visual outline, it should be like a receiver for short range, if it detects heat in its fov it outputs a small estimated distance that fluctuates, also the area it detects the heat source changes around the ship, so reducing the radius of the detector won\u2019t be perfect as it will just pick it up less often the closer to the edge of the area you get."}
